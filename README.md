# Project Tracker

Project Tracker is an app designed to help keep developers organized.  Whether it's for personal use, or when working on large teams, Project Tracker is there to optimize your project management.

 Developers can add new projects to their dashboard, create tickets for bug tracking, feature requests and more.  Communicate with your team via comment section when you've updated a feature, or squashed a bug!
