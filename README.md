# Project Tracker

Project Tracker is an app designed to help keep developers organized.  Whether it's for personal use, or when working on large teams, Project Tracker is there to optimize your project management.

 Developers can add new projects to their dashboard, create tickets for bug tracking, feature requests and more.  Communicate with your team via comment section when you've updated a feature, or squashed a bug!

***

## How it works
Once a developer logs in, they are directed to their Project Dashboard.

Here, users can see their list of projects, search through and filter by project status.  Most importantly, here is where developers will add a project to their dashboard.

Once a project has been added, it's time to get organized!

Click on the project and be redirected to the project details page.  Here, pertinent information regarding the status of the project, assigned developers and associated tickets are displayed.

A project can be modified by changing the status of the project, or by adding and removing other developers.

Add a ticket with ease and flexibility!  Whether there is feature request, bug fix, or general issue that needs to be resolved, enter the ticket information as you like and set a priority so that everyone on the team knows what needs to be tackled first.

Each ticket has it's own comment section so updates can be communicated in an organized way.

Below you will see William commented that he will reopen the ticket to complete some testing, but the ticket remained Resolved.  Alice will go in and edit the ticket to reflect the correct status, and provide more ticket details while she is there.
